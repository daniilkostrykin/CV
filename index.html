    Office culture has for decades been blighted by jargon that has replaced perfectly usable words and phrases in English. Phrases like “disrupt,” “leverage,” “paradigm shift,” “synergy,” “touch base,” “drill down,” “think outside the box,” “blue-sky thinking” and “best practices” are now part of the increasingly crowded workplace word map.
    That’s despite the fact that “clear thinking” is more descriptive than “blue-sky thinking.” “Examine very closely” tells you far more about an action than “drill down.” But perhaps that’s the point of office jargon. It’s a way of saying we’re going to do something without really saying what in detail. To find out what someone thinks or is going to do, we have to question and question until we get an answer in plain English.

    “What did I tell you!" — cried Grandma Georgina. "He's round the twist! He's bogged as a beetle! He's dotty as a dingbat! He's got rats in the roof!”

    I found Monday night’s extravaganza a mixed bag. The comedians were dire, their jokes wholly inappropriate for the occasion, while much of the singing sounded off-key, even when Sir Elton John was at the keyboards.
    It is telling that the best contribution was given not by a performer but by Prince Charles whose witty, warm-hearted speech put Lenny Henry and Rob Brydon to shame.
    A greater, more surprising failure was the BBC’s disastrous coverage of the river pageant on Sunday. In its obsession with celebrity it produced a self indulgent mess, lacking authority or historical analysis.

    One day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room. She carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady. She was a very little girl, with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying: "Goodness me ! Why didn't you keep up with us?"
    Mrs. Parker showed her the double parlours. "In this closet," she said, "one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal"
    "But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist," said Miss Leeson, with a shiver.
    Mrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists, and led the way to the second floor back.
    "Eight dollars?" said Miss Leeson. "Dear me! I'm not Hetty if I do look green. I'm just a poor little working girl. Show me something higher and lower."
    Presently the tocsin call of "Clara!" sounded to the world the state of Miss Leeson's purse. A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian stairway, thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words "Two dollars!"
    "I'll take it!" sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed.
